3. Clone that repo to your computer.

I first accessed my Week 1 file with cd command
Then :
git clone https://github.com/audedef/IronAude.git


4. Create a file in that folder. Name it about.txt and add a fun fact about yourself. 

cd IronAude
touch aboutaude.txt
echo "blablabla" > aboutaude.txt



5. Add the file you just created to the git.

git add aboutaude.txt


6. Commit the changes.

git commit -m "fun fact about me"


7. Push the changes to the GitHub and check your repository to make sure everything is there.

git push origin master
